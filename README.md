# OPTICAT
Create optimized ICA training (OPTICAT) data for EEG data recorded during free viewing 

This is a short and simple script to create "optimized" ICA training data for the ocular correction of EEG experiments involving multiple saccades. For the script to work, you will need the (overweighting) functions included in the EYE-EEG extension for EEGLAB. EYE-EEG can be freely downloaded at http://www2.hu-berlin.de or from GITHUB (https://github.com/olafdimigen/eye-eeg). I will soon add more code that allows to test whether the ICA correction distorted intervals without significant oculomotor activity. For more details, please consult the BioRxiv preprint at at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/30/446955:
