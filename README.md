# OPTICAT: Create optimized ICA training (OPTICAT) data for ocular correction of EEG recorded during free viewing

This repository contains two things:

1. A simple script to run an optimized eye tracker-guided ICA on your own data
2. The code of the main scripts used in the corresponding paper

from free viewing EEG. NeuroImage, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116117 


Please see the scripts itself for more infos und documentation.
